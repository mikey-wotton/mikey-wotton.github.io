Now this was a tough map! Probably the last video I'll bother editing as I think I'm nearing the end of my love for Beat Saber having played it far too often these last few months, but I have thoroughly enjoyed all the new skills and curiosities it has afforded me.<br><br>

I even got to thank the map's creator, Kolezan, as he found my Youtube upload. The internet is a small place after all.

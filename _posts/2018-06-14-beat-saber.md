So this June I have been able to try out my friends HTC Vive and a new game that goes along side it, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL39Sg2AqWg">Beat Saber</a>.

This game was so much fun I began inspecting how the maps and content were formed and found them to be made from simple JSON files alongside .ogg music files. This meant I could create my own custom maps without much hardship, so I did!

I learned about music timing, game development, and got to enjoy using VR for the first time doing this and will undoubtedly be doing more in the future. You can download the maps I created at these links:

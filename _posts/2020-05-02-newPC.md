After 7 years of service, I finally retired my first at home build to get something with a bit more power behind it. Today I finished putting the pieces together a into the new case and transferred my windows licence. I had to do a fair bit of research as I'm not as up-to-date on hardware as I'd like but the process was a lot of fun and a lot of learning. I hadn't even heard of the latest storage form factor M.2 or the interface NVMe!

Specs:
<li>
<ul>AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 3.6 GHz 8-Core Processor</ul>
<ul>ASRock X570 Steel Legend ATX AM4 Motherboard</ul>
<ul>Crucial Ballistix 16 GB (2 x 8 GB) DDR4-3200 Memory</ul>
<ul>Sabrent Rocket 1 TB M.2-2280 NVME Solid State Drive</ul>
<ul>MSI GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER 8 GB VENTUS XS OC Video Card</ul>
<ul>Phanteks Enthoo Pro ATX Full Tower Case</ul>
<ul>EVGA SuperNOVA G1+ 750 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply</ul>

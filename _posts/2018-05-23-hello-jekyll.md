Welcome! If you've made it here hopefully you're interested in finding out a little more about me and not just taken a wrong turn somewhere.

This is the latest reincarnation of my personal website, taking advantage of Github's free hosting with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Pages</a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. 

On here you will find some information about me, my career and any projects I have been working on. I'm always adding more, so be sure to check back now and then!

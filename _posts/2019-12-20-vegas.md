title: Viva Las Vegas Video Editing

---

I ticked off another of my bucket list and flew to sin city itself, Las Vegas. Once again I put my video editing skills to use and made myself a montage of the things I saw which you can check out below. Vegas really is a crazy place with what it seems like more money than knowing what to do with it, in one instance I saw the night sky being lit up by flame throwers whilst homeless people gathered on the edges of the show for warmth. Certainly an eye opening place and one I might return to someday.

To stop myself from getting rusty I wanted to pick up some programming challenges during my down time. 

I found this excellent website named <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">HackerRank</a> which uses a web version of most programming language IDEs which allows you to attempt many different challenges of varying difficulty in pretty much any language. 

Completing challenges earns you badges on your profile which you can then use as evidence of your work, you can view my profile

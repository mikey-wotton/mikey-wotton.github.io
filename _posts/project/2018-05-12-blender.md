The final assessment for my Computer Graphics and Animation module. 

This module brought about learning on techniques for modelling, manipulating, capturing, displaying, and storing 2D and 3D scenes, digital images, animations, and even video. This project in particular required practical application of many of these techniques. 

I modelled each item within Blender and arranged it within the final scene, receiving a <strong>94/100 mark</strong>.

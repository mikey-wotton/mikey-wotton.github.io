Working as the Project Manager, I led my team in the creation of "Trunk". Trunk is a link aggregation website, like Reddit or Digg, with features designed to combat online community segregation. 

These features required researching the problem and the current web standards, designing, testing, iterating, and then finally deploying solutions before finally gathering user feedback on our solutions.

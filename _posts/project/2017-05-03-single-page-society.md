---I noticed a problem with a lot of societies at University having a limited or generally non-responsive web presence and thought I would set about trying to resolve this. After speaking with many socities the major hurdled seem to be the lack of technical skills to update the site once deployed. To resolve this, I built an easy to edit site template using PHP variables and include statements. Check out the video below to see it in action.

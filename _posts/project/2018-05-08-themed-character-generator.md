In my final year of University I elected to take the Computational Creativity module provided by Kent asked some interesting questions.

1. How do we define creativity?
2. What would it mean for someone or something to exhibit creativity?
3. Can a computer exhibit creativity?

Throughout this module I discovered and learned about topics relating to building and evaluating creative systems and the philosophical implications of these systems.

Take a look at this video of it working and how it works in the background.

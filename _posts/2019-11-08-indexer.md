A few friends of mine who are going through university were discussing a major pain point for their projects. For their larger projects, they needed to produce an index file which would list and link each of their files and provide information as to what it was for and how it was to be used. Annoying but necessary for projects where directories can be in the hundreds and total files in the thousands. I couldn't help them naming what those files might be for but I could help with the listing part.

In steps the indexer, a small go executable which can create an index.html file, with click open/close folders, listing each directory and all sub-directories and files within. A quick and dirty example of automating a tedious job!

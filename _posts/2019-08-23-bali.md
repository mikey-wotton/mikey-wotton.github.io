After having decided I needed to get out of my comfort zone of holidaying in Europe, the proverbial dart landed on the Globe at Bali, Indonesia.

The link below is my creation after editing down hundreds of hours of footage to just six minutes. A lot of learning which I'm going to use to do even better next time, hope you enjoy!

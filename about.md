Welcome!

My name is Mikey Wotton and I'm a Software Engineer working for Visa Europe with a Computer Science degree from <strong>University of Kent</strong>.

I broke my leg when I was 13 years old which left me home bound for almost 5 months which is where my love for computers started, tinkering with my broken family PC. I eventually got it working and from there kept learning more and more!

I built this site as a learning experience and as a showcase for my skills in programming and web development, you can find some of my projects and work hosted here alongside some information about me and my personality.

If you have any further questions do not hesitate to get in touch!
